#
# A very simple example configuration showing how to launch Nginx as a non-root
# user without sudo access.
#
# Adjust the paths and other settings for your specific circumstances. They are
# currently configured for use in a Vagrant VM in which the /mnt/xfsdata/simg/opt/ui/nginx folder is
# writable by the non-root user running Nginx.
#
# Note that as Nginx is not launched as root, it cannot bind to privileged
# ports lower than 1024.
#
# Usage: nginx -c /path/to/this/nginx.conf
#

# This error log will be written regardless of server scope error_log
# definitions, so we have to set this here in the main scope.
#
# Even doing this, Nginx will still try to create the default error file, and
# log a non-fatal error when it fails. After that things will work, however.
